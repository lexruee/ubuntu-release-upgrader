NEWS for Computer Janitor
=========================

This file summarizes mainly user-visible changes. For detailed
changes, please see the bzr commit log messages.

Version 1.11, released 2009-02-03

    * Renamed to Computer Janitor. The old name, Cruft Remover, was using
      computer jargon (cruft) and gave the wrong impression (the program
      does not just remove stuff).
      
    * New plugin to compact the dpkg status file, from Michael Vogt.

Version 1.10.5, released 2009-01-16

    * Upon startup, we now verify that the package lists look sane by
      checking for the dash and gzip packages. If they're not available,
      we assume something is badly wrong and we won't continue. This
      makes is very unlikely that people will accidentally remove all
      their packages because apt didn't have any package lists available.

    * A further safeguard: the running kernel and related packages
      won't ever be considered cruft anymore.
      
    * It is now no longer enough to click on the "Cleanup" button to
      initiate changes (pacxkage removals etc). Instead, a dialog window
      will pop up and the user has to click on "OK" to continue.

    * A .deb package's short description is now shown in the cruft
      description. This will help users have an idea what it's all
      about. (It's insufficient, but was all that there was time for
      for the Ubuntu intrepid release schedule.)
      
    * Columns in the cruft list now have titles, to make it easier
      to understand what ticks mean (remove cruft? don't remove
      cruft?).
      
    * The program now reads whitelists in /etc/cruft-remover.d. Cruft
      named in files in that directory will _not_ be removed.
      
    * The plugin to remove packages apt considers autoremovable is now
      enabled. It has been written ages ago, but not been enabled by
      default until now.

    * The application now uses the icon it has.

    * Added Polish translation from Piotr Makowski.

    * Added Finnish translation from Lars Wirzenius and Timo Jyrinki.

Version 1.10.4, released 2008-10-27

    * Quick bug fixes for the Ubuntu 8.10 release. A proper release
      of Cruft Remover will be made later.

Version 1.10.3, released 2008-10-14

    * Bug fixes to how messages are logged, primarily to how character
      sets are encoded. Found by James Westby.

Version 1.10.2, released 2008-10-14

    IMPORTANT CHANGES:
    
    * If setting up logging to syslog fails, don't crash. Thanks,
      Ricardo Wurmus. (LP:#274970)

    * The program now supports translations via gettext. A Finnish
      translation was added. (LP:#279580)

    * Handles errors by giving nice(r) error messages also in the
      command line version. The GTK+ version already did that.
      Thanks, Marco Rodrigues. (LP:#281657)

    MINOR CHANGES:
    
    * Wording in manual page fixed. Thanks, James Westby.

    * Non-functional help button hidden. Thanks, Lo√Øc Minier. (LP:#279577)
    
    * Cruft description in the GTK+ user interface is cleared after cruft has 
      been cleaned up.

Version 1.10.1, released 2008-10-06

    * Bugfix: Cruft in /etc/fstab now goes away from the GTK user interface
      after a cleanup. Found by James Westby, thanks.

    * cruft-remover-gtk now has a manual page.

    * Bugfix: The GTK user interface now no longer imports the gtk and
      gobject Python modules globally, but only when the code actually
      runs, to prevent them from being loaded when running unit tests,
      etc. (The GTK UI code is not unit tested.)

Version 1.10, released 2008-09-30

    * Important fixes to how GTK+ and threads are used: now all GTK+
      stuff happens only in the main thread. This turns out to be
      easier to get right than using gtk.gdk.threads_enter and _leave
      correctly in all situations, and also allows things like
      gtk.Dialog.run to be used.
      
    * Missing test module for the deb_plugin module written.
    
    * SystemError exceptions (which are raised by python-apt when
      there is a dpkg error) are now handled, and an error displayed
      to the user. This fixes LP: #275034.
      
    * The GTK user interface now displays the version number at startup.
      The command line interface shows it with the new --version option.

Version 1.9, released 2008-09-26

    * Bug fix: cruft-remover-gtk now correctly refreshes the list of
      cruft after a bug has been fixed. (LP:274715)
      
    * Bug fix: cruft-remover-gtk disables the "Cleanup" button if there
      is nothing to clean up. (LP:274717)

Version 1.8, released 2008-09-23

    * The GTK user interface now lets you select a row without toggling
      the status of the cruft. This is useful, because the description
      of each cruft is shown for the selected row only.
      
    * Both the GTK and command line user interfaces now attempt to 
      be more helpful in describing what each piece of cruft is.

Version 1.7, released 2008-09-12

    * First real public release, despite the version number. (If you have
      seen any earlier versions, they were not real. Not real, I tell
      you! Not real! They didn't exist! Really!)
