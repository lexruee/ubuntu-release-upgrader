2006-10-11:
	- keep pixbuf loader reference around so that we
          have one after the upgrade when the old 
          /usr/lib/gtk-2.0/loader/2.4.0/ loader is gone.
          This fixes the problem of missing stock-icons
	  after the upgrade. Also revalidate the theme
  	  in each step.

	- special case the packages affected by the Breaks changes

	- moved the logging into the /var/log/dist-upgrade/ dir
	- change the obsoletes calculation when run without network and
          consider demotions as obsoletes then (because we can't really
	  use the "pkg.downloadable" hint without network)
	- uploaded

        - add more sanity checking, if no valid mirror is found in the 
          sources.list ask for "dumb" rewrite
        - if nothing valid was found after a dumb rewrite, add official
          sources
        - don't report install TIMEOUT over and over in the log
        - report what package caused a install TIMEOUT
2006-04-27:
	- add a additonal sanity check after the rewriting of the sources.list
          (check for BaseMetaPkgs still in the cache)
        - on abort reopen() the cache to force writing a new 
          /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin
        - use a much more compelte mirror list (based on the information 
          from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive)
2006-04-25:
