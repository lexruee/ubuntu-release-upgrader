        - add more sanity checking, if no valid mirror is found in the 
          sources.list ask for "dumb" rewrite
        - if nothing valid was found after a dumb rewrite, add official
          sources
        - don't report install TIMEOUT over and over in the log
        - report what package caused a install TIMEOUT

	- add a additonal sanity check after the rewriting of the sources.list
          (check for BaseMetaPkgs still in the cache)
        - on abort reopen() the cache to force writing a new 
          /var/cache/apt/pkgcache.bin
        - use a much more compelte mirror list (based on the information 
          from https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Archive)
