General
-------

The dist-upgrader is designed to make upgrades for ubuntu (or similar
distributions) easy and painless. It supports both network mode and
cdrom upgrades. The cdromupgrade will ask if it should use the network
or not. There is a wrapper script "cdromugprade" (that assumes the
file of the upgrade life in
CDROM_ROOT/dists/stable/dist-upgrader/binary-all/) that can be put
onto the CD and it will support upgrades directly from the CD.


Configuration
-------------

The DistUpgrade.cfg format is based on the python ConfigParser.

It supports the following sections:

[View] - controls the output 

[Distro] - global distribution specfic options
BaseMetaPkgs: 
  the basic meta-pkgs that must be installed (ubuntu-base usually)
MetaPkgs: 
  packages that define a "desktop" (e.g. ubuntu-desktop)
PostUpgrade{Install,Remove,Purge}: 
  action right after the upgrade was calculated in the cache (marking 
  happens *before* the cache.commit())
ForcedObsoletes: 
  Obsolete packages that the user is asked about after the upgrade (marking 
  happens *after* the cache.commit())

[$meta-pkg]
